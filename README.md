### I code and I know things

### Currently, I'm working on some small JavaScript projects to reinforce what I learned in coding bootcamp. After that, I plan on doing the same thing with React, nodeJS, mySQL, and PHP

# In the meantime, I'm also learning Python. It's a lot of work, but I am driven and passionate about coding and always like to absorb knowledge

# I'm looking to collaborate on any open source projects out there.

# Ask me about
1. What got me into coding.
2. What I like about it.
3. What I'm doing when I'm not coding.
4. What I feel my biggest strengths and weaknesses are.
5. Who my favorite sports teams are.
